				<li>Performance improving all the time - 3D games on the desktop</li>
				<li>For now... until the Web gets hardware access (WebAPIs)</li>
			</ul>

		<footer class="notes">
			Native apps are built and optimized for one single environment and purpose and are fixed in their state.
			Native applications need to be written for every single device and every new platform from scratch whereas an HTML5 App allows you to support mobiles, tablets and desktops with the same product.
			Native Apps on the other hand do in a lot of cases need an upgrade and force the end user to buy new hardware or they’ll not get the product at all.

				<h2>HTML5 can not be monetized?</h2>
			</header>

			<ul>
				<li>App stores - discovery and find-ability is getting increasingly harder</li>
				<li>No transparency in most current app stores</li>
				<li>Many apps are HTML5 wrapped in a shell (e.g. Phonegap)</li>
				<li>Financial Times releasing their app as HTML5 and making a better profit than with the native one</li>
			</ul>

		<footer class="notes">
			HTML5 is a technology stack based on open web technologies. Saying that HTML5 has no monetization model is like saying the web can not be monetized (which is especially ironic when this is written on news sites that show ads).

				<h2>HTML5 can not be offline?</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Web apps don't need to be online all the time</li>
				<li>Simplest Web Storage API</li>
				<li>IndexedDB (for Chrome and Firefox) or WebSQL (for iOS and Safari)</li>
				<li>Libraries like Lawnchair available to make it easy for developers to use</li>
				<li>AppCache - store the app itself offline</li>
			</ul>

		<footer class="notes">
			As HTML5 is a web technology stack the knee-jerk reaction is thinking that you would have to be online all the time to use them. This is plain wrong. There are many ways to store content offline in a HTML5 application. The simplest way is the Web Storage API which is supported across all modern browsers (excluding Opera mini which is a special case as it sends content via a cloud service and has its own storage tools). You can also store the application itself offline using AppCache which is supported by all but Internet Explorer. If you have more complex data to store than Web Storage provides you can use either IndexedDB (for Chrome and Firefox) or WebSQL (for iOS and Safari). To work around the issues there are libraries like Lawnchair available to make it easy for developers to use.

				<h2>HTML5 has no development environment?</h2>
			</header>

			<ul>
				<li>Web more flexible - a variety of tools</li>
				<li>CMSes - a publishing platform for everyone</li>
				<li>Developer Tools built into all browsers</li>
				<li>Remote debugging in Firefox speeds up Mobile development</li>
				<li>WYSIWYG style development do exist (e.g. Adobe Edge)</li>
				<li>A fixed environment would stifle the platform</li>
			</ul>

		<footer class="notes">
			One concern often mentioned is that HTML5 lacks in tooling for developers. Strangely enough you never hear that argument from developers but from people who want to buy software to make their developers more effective instead of letting them decide what makes them effective.
			HTML5 development at its core is web development and there is a quite amazingly practical development environment for that available. Again, the main issue is a misunderstanding of the web.

			Businesses need to let their users access their core applications quickly and easily. With HTML5, the browser is becoming the main business platform. Features like websockets, offline storage and rich user interface let you create amazing business web applications. HTML5 brings substantial benefits for companies that no other IT model can — in simplicity, cost, security, flexibility and mobility.
